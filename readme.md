## Administration Information Management (AIM) System 
_AIM system is a result of merging Human Resources Management System (HRMS) and Electronic File Management System (e-FMS)._
AIMS is intended to make the online management of human resources possible. More specifically, AIMS controls and manages the personal database such that any user with different role types such as HRM, HRO, Admin and DIT Staff will be able to manipulate their personal data. In additional to data manipulation, the proposed HRMS will provide authentication and authorization mechanism. Additionally, AIMS will be responsible for smooth and smart online handling and movement of files across various offices at DIT in accordance to the organization structure
